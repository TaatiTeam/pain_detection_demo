A minimal repository to demo how to use our pain detection model.
After installing the requirement, you should be able to run `test.py`.
It should print out 4.72 pain score (PSPI) for the frames in the `example_frames` folder.

`test.py` will also do a “frame rate test” and print out how many frames per second your system is capable of processing.
